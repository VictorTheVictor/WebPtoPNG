# WebPtoPNG
Windows batch/CMD .webp to .png converter

Usage:
Install Image Magick (https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php, very first Windows download),
edit the im_path variable to match your install,
right click any .webp file, "open with..." and select this script.

Simply double click any .wepb file and it instantly gets converted to a .png, given the script is configured correctly.
Edit the script with Notepad/++ to change behavior.
Comments placed on instructions on how to do that.

Works like magick!
